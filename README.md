# PERG Viewer
This software application handles the reading and pre-processing of the csv files from the "The PERG-IOBA Database", a repository of pattern electroretinogram. This database can denoise the signal using wavelet transform based on the input level of decomposition.

## Dependencies
The application is written in Python and heavily used **PySimpleGUI** library for the graphical user interface and **PyWavelet** for the wavelet decomposition. It also uses **Pandas** extensive dataframe processing functions.
